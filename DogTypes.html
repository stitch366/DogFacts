<h2>Dog Types</h2>
<p>In order to categorize the various different dog breeds the American Kennel Club created a system under which a breed of dog is grouped in one of 8 different types of dogs.
   Seven of these different groups were created based on what the breed was initially created for and the 8th group is was created based on breeds not reconized by the AKC. 
   These classifications are as follows:
</p>
   <ul class="linkList">
   <li><a href="#herding">Herding</a></li>
   <li><a href="#hound">Hound</a></li>
   <li><a href="#sporting">Sporting</a></li>
   <li><a href="#terrier">Terrier</a></li>
   <li><a href="#toy">Toy</a></li>
   <li><a href="#working">Working</a></li>
   <li><a href="#non-sporting">Non-Sporting</a></li>
   <li><a href="#mixed">Miscellaneous/Mixed Breed</a></li>
   </ul>
<h3 id="herding">The Herding Group</h3>
<p>
The Herding group is made up of dog breeds that were bred to help farmers herd live stock. 
The dogs in this in this group tend to have a lot of stamina and athletic ability which allows them to work long hours in poor weather conditions and rough terrain. 
Additionally, dog of this group are very intelligent and are able to problem solve which allows them to work on their own if need be.
Dogs of this group need to work and if not provided with it will tend to make their own. 
A dog of this group may start chasing cars or bicycles, or start 'herding' people as a result of their herding instincts.
</p>
<h3 id="hound">The Hound Group</h3>
<p>
The Hound group is made up of dog breeds that were bred help hunt and includes the Blood hound the best sense of smell, and two of the fastest dog breeds, the Greyhound and Whippet. 
This group can be sub grouped into sighthounds and scenthounds. 
These dogs are very independent and tend to decide on their own terms if they will obey a command and they will not stop chasing their prey until they have either caught it or have it cornered it. 
This makes it Important, regardless of which of the two subgroups a hound falls under, that they are supervised when outdoors and only be left off-leash in a fenced area.
</p>
<h3 id="sporting">The Sporting Group</h3>
<p>
The Sporting group, also known as the Gundog group in Europe, is made up of dog breeds that were bred to help hunt fowl. 
A breed in this group can provide this assistance in one of three different ways locating, flushing out, and retrieving the hunter’s quarry. 
Since these breeds were created to work very closely with people they are typically very friendly and easy to train. 
Additionally, these dogs are very eager to please and catch on to new tasks rather quickly. 
This makes members of this group great family pets, along as they receive a good amount of exercise daily.
</p>
<h3 id="terrier">The Terrier Group</h3>
<p>
The Terrier group is made up of dogs meant to hunt pests such as foxes and rodents. 
Dogs in this group are typically smaller in size and will use their small size to hunt their prey both above and below ground. 
Members of this group tend to be feisty, tenacious, courageous, and energetic dogs with an attitude to match the small prey they hunt. 
Additionally these dogs typically don’t get along well with other pets and tend to be difficult to train.
</p>
<h3 id="toy">The Toy Group</h3>
<p>
The Toy group is made up of dogs who were bred to give comfort to their human companions and are among the smallest dog breeds. 
Many of these breeds were developed in monasteries and royal courts as lapdogs. 
However, despite that these breeds were meant to provide comfort and companion ship they still can be prone to the behaviors of breeds in other groups. 
For example, the largest of the toy breeds, The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, has remained true to its spaniel heritage as a hunter of small fowl. 
Additionally, many toys make great watch dogs due to their barking tendencies.
</p>
<h3 id="working">The Working Group</h3>
<p>
The Working Group is made up of dogs that created to perform a task of some sort. 
These tasks include but are not limited to pulling sleds or carts, aiding fishermen with their nets, rescuing travelers, and guarding both livestock and their human family. 
These furry blue-collar workers are courageous, intelligent, hardworking, and are among some of the largest dog breeds. 
These dogs typically are not considered good family pets due to their size and risk for injury they possess.
</p>
<h3 id="non-sporting">The Non-Sporting Group</h3>
<p>
The Non-sporting group is the least defined out of the 8 different groups of dogs groups. 
The breeds that make up this group are breeds that are recognized by the AKC, but don’t quite fit into the Sporting, Herding, Hound, Working, or Toy groups. 
Many of the Breeds in this group tend to be small-medium in size and have recognizable ancestors in the other groups of dogs recognized by the AKC. 
Additionally, several of these breeds are used for companion ship in the modern world.
</p>
<h3 id="mixed">Miscellaneous/Mixed Breed</h3>
<p>
	The Miscellaneous/Mixed Breed group is made up of breeds that are not officially recognized by the AKC and mixed breed dogs. 
	This means that these dogs are unable to participate in AKC dog shows, so if your looking for a show dog you don't want to pick a pup that falls under this group. 
	Additionally, this group is the also the most diverse of the 8 groups because it includes mixed breed dogs as well as AKC unrecognized breeds. 
	This makes it even more important that you study up on the breed and understand what the breed was created for so that you know what to behaviors to expect.
	Also, for a mixed breed pup it is best to to study up on the breeds the dog is descended from and get a feel for the pups personality before adopting.
