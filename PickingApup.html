<h3>Where to Adopt</h3>
<p>
There are three different types places you can adopt a dog or puppy from:
<ul class="list">
<li>Pet Shops</li>
<li>Shelters</li>
<li>Breeders</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h4>Pet Shops</h4>
<p>
The dogs and pups offered by pet shops tend to be pure-bred and and tend to have a friendly atmosphere that most people are comfortable in; however, while pet shops may seem like a good place to adopt a dog more often than not those dogs and pups come from puppy mills.
Puppy mills are organizations that breed dogs solely for profit; these organizations over-breed their dogs and keep them in horrible conditions. 
These organizations are out right inhumane and by purchasing puppies from a pet stores only lines the wallets of the greedy jerks who run them.
Puppy mills don't deserve the money they make with how poorly they treat their animals, so don't buy a pup from a pet store.
</p>
<h4>Shelters</h4>
<p>
Animal shelters are home to many unwanted pure-bred and mix-breed dogs and puppies; many of which wind up getting put-down simply because there is nobody who wants them.
Adopting a dog or pup from a shelter you not only give them a home but also save their life. 
Additionally, its' overall cheaper to adopt from a shelter since the shelters want the animals to get adopted.
Shelters have their animals spayed and neutered and have the cost of the procedure is covered by the animal's adoption price.
This keeps you form having to make a separate transaction that operation which would be more expensive.
</p>
<h4>Breeders</h4>
<p>
Dog Breeders are people who breed dogs for a living. 
Breeders typically sell pure-bred puppies and specialize in one to two breeds of dogs.
Breeders keep the parents of the pups they sell as pets and try to find good homes for them.
Adopting a dog form a breeder while is a more expensive alternative to getting a shelter.
If you want a pure-bred pup of a specific breed looking for a breeder in your local area is a good and reliable route to getting the breed of dog you want.
